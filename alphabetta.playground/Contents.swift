## Overview
 AlphaBetta is a *point and click* game for kids, which tells the story of Alpha, Betta and Mom
 
## History
Alpha was the first child of the family. When Betta was born Mom didn't have time to take care and have fun with her kids, and handle with all her work. Because of that, Alpha was jealous when her mother stayed with Betta.
 
 One day Mom ask Alpha to take care of Betta. Even feeling sad, Alpha did what Mom waks. What she didn't know was that she would find out that she could have fun with her little sister and after all she really loved Betta.
 
## Inpiration
This game was inpired my two sisters, Emily(10) and Eduarda(2) who lives a similar situation with our mom. Because of that I decided to create this playground, to show how they both can have fun togheter despite the difference of age and lack of time of our mother.
